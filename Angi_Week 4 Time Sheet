Week 4 Time Sheet
In the first 10 hours, I have recovered my windows system, built all the IDEs and get them ready in use.
I have spent 6 hours in watching the vedios on Youtube to get familiar with C# and Visual Studio.
It takes me another 5 hours in searching on line to learn how to access to Github and My SQL express.
Also the teamwork has been held for 2 hours.
